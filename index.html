      <h1>Elevator Test</h1>
      <h3>
        There is an elevator in a building with a certain amount of floors. This
        elevator can take a max number of people at a time or max of total
        weight. Given that a set of people and their weight and the floor they
        need to stop, how many stops has the elevator taken to serve all the
        people? Consider the elevator serves in “first come first serve” basis
        and the order for the queue can not be changed.
      </h3>

      <h4>
        Create a function based off the following criteria in javascript. Make
        sure you consider all values and possible limits provided in each
        example.
      </h4>

      <h3>Example 1:</h3>
      <p>
        This array has the list of people waiting in line for the elevator with
        their weights and floor they need to go too. The array is listed in the
        same order as the line. The elevator has a max capicty of 400 pounds and
        can take a max of 2 people at a time. The building has 6 total floors.
      </p>
      <code>
        const line = [{ weight:150, floor: 2, },{ weight:200, floor: 3, },{
        weight:120, floor: 5, },{ weight:80, floor: 2, },{ weight:180, floor: 4,
        },{ weight:170, floor: 4, }];
      </code>

      <h3>Example 2:</h3>
      <p>
        This array has the list of people waiting in line for the elevator with
        their weights and floor they need to go too. The array is listed in the
        same order as the line. The elevator has a max capicty of 600 pounds and
        can take a max of 4 people at a time. The building has 7 total floors.
      </p>
      <code>
        const line = [{ weight:100, floor: 6, },{ weight:300, floor: 2, },{
        weight:80, floor: 2, },{ weight:100, floor: 5, },{ weight:120, floor: 3,
        },{ weight:160, floor: 4, },{ weight:120, floor: 6, },{ weight:250,
        floor: 2, },{ weight:180, floor: 5, },{ weight:120, floor: 4, }];
      </code>

      <h4>
        Remember these are just example data, the function should be able to
        work regardless of the dataset you provide.
